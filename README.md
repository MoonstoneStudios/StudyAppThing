# StudyAppThing
 
### **This app is unfinished!!!** 
This project will **not** be worked on for the foreseeable future.

### What did I learn from this project?
- Avalonia, even though it is a popular app framework, still lacks some features that I need to implement myself (ex: a sticky-header) or find libraries to do it for me (ex: a progress ring)
- I learned a lot about MVVM on this project


## Screenshots of current state of project
Be aware that all of these screenshots are testing stuff so there are some silly names and placeholder stuff.
